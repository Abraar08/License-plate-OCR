Your task:

Create a licence plate OCR algorithm, you have been given 300+ images of licence plates of various quality these have been tagged with their actual text
If these text are wrong you can safely rename them to their actual state.
Feel free to use any library, existing OCR model or otherwise to solve this problem as this is a case of research and showing how you come up with a solution.
Include links to resources you used.
See main.py for the stub for your function you are allowed to modify this file in any way you like but it must produce a
guess from the image and compare it with the actual plates text
We are looking for clean readable code so heavy use of commentting is encouraged.

To get started install python as neccessary run
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Also include with your answer a pdf explaining
